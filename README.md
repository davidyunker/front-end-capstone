# Before You GO 

An app for Pokemon Go users to keep track of their favorites routes for hunting Pokemon. The application utilizes the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, Weather Underground API and the Poke API. The application was created using Angular, Materialize and Firebase. 

See the deployed version of this application here: https://before-you-go.firebaseapp.com

NOTE: You'll need to have CORS enabled (I recommend this plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) when creating your route.
